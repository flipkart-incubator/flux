# Flux
Flux is an asynchronous, scalable, optionally multi-tenant & distributed and reliable state machine based orchestrator. 
Flux can be used to build Workflows and Reactive apps that are stateful. 

Flux quick introduction video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gddh5J2qB3k). Please go through the [wiki](https://github.com/flipkart-incubator/flux/wiki) pages to find out more about flux.

## Why Flux
A number of real-world stateful systems like workflows, event-driven reactive apps can be modeled as state machines. Event sources are many - 
user actions, messages passed between systems and data changes to business entities. Flux provides a programming model and 
client SDK to build event-driven reactive apps. The runtime allows to run multiple state machine instances concurrently.

## Flux Visualization & Monitoring
Flux allows you to monitor real-time execution of all running state machine tasks. Default path for dashboard is http://localhost:9999/admin/dashboard

Additionally, you can also inspect individual state machine execution DAGs and audit data:

## Documentation and Examples
Flux examples are under "examples" module. Each example can be run independently. Flux has very few dependencies and the simplest
examples can be run in under 5 minutes.
Documentation is continuously being added to the Flux [wiki](https://github.com/flipkart-incubator/flux/wiki)

## Building with Flux
The Flux system design is organized into multiple layers to support building, testing, deploying and operating workflows in a shared environment:

![Layers](https://github.com/flipkart-incubator/flux/raw/master/docs/flux-high-level.png) 

* UI - Provides for inspecting workflow execution and administration tasks on deployed instances/templates
* API/Modelling - Provides primitives for modelling State machines and reacting to state transitions, complex DAG-like workflows
* Runtime - Multiple variants from single JVM to distributed and isolated runtimes
* Integration - Support for operating the system i.e. Monitoring, Metrics and RPC mechanisms for running isolated runtimes
* Deployment - Providing mechanisms for cluster discovery, work distribution
